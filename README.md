# CMD
CMD is a collection of command line programs for various uses. Many of these are simple programs that do a single task, quickly and easily in the command line.

These programs were built because they are quite inconvenient to do in your head, but trivial enough to not want to search them, find a website, and use that.

# Installation
I recommend adding CMD directly to your PATH environment variable, but if you're worried about name clashes, only add the programs you will use. 

The executables are placed in the bin folder when the program is built. You can also download the latest versions of the executables in the releases tab.

# deltat
deltat (Time Delta) is a  program that takes 2 dates and gives the difference between them in days and weeks.

To use deltat, run deltat.exe with two dates as command line arguments.

Format: deltat year month date year month date. 

Examples: 
1. deltat 2020 06 20 2020 03 10
2. deltat today 1991 02 12

You can also run deltat with no arguments for help.
